## English

In my opinion, this manual is a **Must-Read** to make the most out of it and learn everything properly. 
You're going to spend somthing about 4 months in it.
So I kindly ask you to spend some of your time right not to understand how everything works.

Before we start, here is where things are:

- Install the deck from [AnkiWeb]() or [this file](Ultimate%20Slovak%20Conjugation.apkg) here, on GitHub.
- To use it, you need to install either [AnkiDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&hl=en) (Android),
[Anki Desktop](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) (Windows | Mac | Linux),
or [AnkiMobile](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387) (iOS).
- You can help in improving this deck or fixing errors here, on [GitHub](https://github.com/Enkidu-Chains/Ultimate-Slovak-Conjugation).

### What is in this deck

**35 Verbs, 800 Flashcards**<br>
The deck has 811 conjugation flashcards. Most of the 35 verbs have 24 flashcards.
You'll find a list of the 35 verbs below.
There's also a separate page explaining in detail how the verbs were selected.

**Are the conjugations accurate?**<br>
For the most part. I used different sources to retrieve the conjugations, they will be mentioned later. 
Also, other parts may have some bugs to fix, so if you find them,
please, make the issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Enkidu-Chains/Ultimate-Slovak-Conjugation/issues).
Or contribute to the project by fixing it yourself on [GitHub](https://github.com/Enkidu-Chains/Ultimate-Slovak-Conjugation).

**What are 24 cards for most verbs?**<br>
- infinitive - 1 card
- verbal noun -  1 card
- participles (masculine singular only) -  3 cards
- present tense - 6 cards
- past tense - 4 cards
- future tense - 6 cards (only for byť)
- imperative tense - 3 cards
- reminder cards - 6 card

**Why these particular 35 verbs?**<br>
Picking these verbs wasn't very hard proces.
The most of the work had been already done by the time I was searching for verbs.
[Here](https://slovake.eu/learning/grammar/classes%2Fverbs) is the site I used to find 14 verbs for base patterns
and 6 modal verbs. And these three [1](http://www.slovnik.org/ru/Ucebnica/Table-04.html),
[2](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Slovak_irregular_verbs)
and [3](https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/slovak-irregular-verbs.2766504/) for irregular verbs.

**Compound tenses and reminder cards**<br>
This deck includes compound tenses: 
- future (compound only for imperfect verbs)
- past (only 6 forms)
- past perfect
- present conditional
- past conditional
- imperative (only two forms)

The mechanism of making them is quite easy to remember so learning them is just rehashing of already learnt forms.
Therefore, they are separated to riminder cards that comes after main set of cards.<br>
You can suspend or remove these card if you don't want to learn them, or already know how to make compound tenses.
It will decrease amount of card to 604 card.
(Warning about future tense, it can be either compound tense or present tense forms for imperfect and perfect verb respectively.
With exception to *byť*, it has its own future tense form.)

### Anatomy of a Flashcard

This section walks you through the various components that can be found on a flashcard. 
(Even though I haven't made flashcards very informative)

**The Prompt**<br>
The prompt is the front side of the card.

![prompt.png](static/images/prompt.png)

- The verb to conjugate appears `[...in brackets...]`
- Here the phrase `Práve` and the eye bulb `⊙` alert you that the tense to use is the *present*.

**The Answer**<br>
The top part of the 'back' of the card shows the answer.

![answer.png](static/images/answer.png)

**Verbs in the Same Family (NOT IMPLEMENTED)**<br> 
The next section shows how other verbs in the same 'family' (conjugation group) conjugate in the same person and tense.
This makes it easier to see how the pattern works.

**Notes**<br>
Notes shows the translation of a verb to English, and some attributes (regular/irregular, modal, perfect/imperfect).
It is not a low of information, be it may be useful. Also, if you click no the infinitive form of a verb in notes,
it will lead you to this [site](https://slovnik.juls.savba.sk/) to look up a verb in different Slovak dictionaries.

![notes.png](static/images/notes.png)

**Link to this Manual and the List of Verbs and Tags**<br>
Each card has a small link to this manual,
just in case you need to quickly consult the list of tags or the number of cards in the next verb, for instance.

![manual.png](static/images/manual.png)

**Tags**<br>
The very bottom of the card shows you all the tags that are attached to it.
These tags enable advanced students to filter a range of cards they would like to review.
