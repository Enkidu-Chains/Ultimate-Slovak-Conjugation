## Description

This deck will help you to learn the conjugation patterns that appears in Slovak language.
Here are 14 verbs for regular conjugation patterns and 18 for irregular ones and 6 modal verbs,
what adds up 35 verbs to learn.

Each verb in the deck can have from 17 to 24 cards, those are:
- infinitive - 1 card
- verbal noun - 0 to 1 card
- participles (masculine singular only) - 0 to 3 cards
- present tense - 6 cards
- past tense - 4 cards
- future tense - 6 cards (only for by≈•)
- imperative tense - 1 to 3 cards
- reminder cards - 5 to 6 card (compound tenses)

In total there are 806 cards in the deck. If suspend reminder cards (), 
the amount of cards will decrease to 592 cards.

All the notes are made automatically by my open source code,
so you can improve it by contribution to the project, or change it to fit your preferences. 

The inspiration for this deck came from seeing the Ultimate Spanish Conjugation deck,
here are several links to it: [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/638411848),
[manual](http://www.asiteaboutnothing.net/w_ultimate_spanish_conjugation.html)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/boolbag/Anki-Goodies/tree/master/Decks/Spanish).

In the end I recommend you to check out the manual to the deck to make the most out of it. 
Good luck in studying! 

P.s. I have also made a similar deck for learning English Irregular Conjugation,
[here it is](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/154222898).
